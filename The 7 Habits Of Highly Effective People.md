Reactive: "There's nothing I can do", "That's just the way I am", "He makes me so mad", "I have to do that".
Proactive: "Let's look at our alternatives", "I can choose a different approach", "I control my own feelings".

The circle of influence is full of "be's", "I can be more patient", "I can be more wise" etc.
The circle of concern contains "have's", "If only I had a more...", "If I had ...."
