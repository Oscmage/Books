# The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People

## Paradigms and principles
The chapter introduces paradigms which is explained as the way we "see" things. It's introduced with the help of the woman which might be old or might be young, it depends of what picture you receive. It also talks about the way to make paradigm shifts.

### Inside-out
"Inside-out" means to start first with self; even more fundamentally, to start with the most inside part of self-with your paradigm, your character, and your motives. It says if you want to have a happy marriage, be the kind of person who generates positive energy and sidesteps negative energy rather than empowering it.

## The Seven Habits An Overview
Habits is something you have the knowledge to do, the skills how to do and the desire to do.

### P/PC Balance
Production/Production capacity. Talks about the goose with the golden eggs and the balance between taking care of the goose to be able to retrieve any golden eggs, but also to make sure to make use of the eggs. Without using the eggs you get, you can't feed the goose and yourself.

## Habit 1, Be Proactive
Reactive: "There's nothing I can do", "That's just the way I am", "He makes me so mad", "I have to do that".
Proactive: "Let's look at our alternatives", "I can choose a different approach", "I control my own feelings".

### Circle of Concern vs Circle of Influence
Being proactive is to have focus on your own circle of influence. The story about the workers that doesn't like their boss and the different responses to that. You control your feelings and how to react on how other people treat you. Being reactive is to focus on how other people treat you rather than focusing on what you can do about it.

The circle of influence is full of "be's", "I can be more patient", "I can be more wise" etc.
The circle of concern contains "have's", "If only I had a more...", "If I had ...."

## Habit 2, Begin with the end in mind
This chapter focuses on the aspects of thinking thoroughly about what is really important for yourself. It's based on the principle that all things are created twice. There's a mental and a physical or second creation to all things. 

It talks about the differences between leadership and management. Management is about how to best accomplish something, while leadership is about what to accomplish. "Are we in the right jungle?" is a leadership question and "Let me sharpen your machete" is a management question.

### Personal mission statement
It focuses on what you want to be and to do and on the values or principles upon which being and doing are based. A personal constitution, changeless. It should focus on the center of influence 

## Habit 3, Put First Things First
This chapter describes how to become principle centered. It talks about the time management matrix (page 151).

1. Urgent & Important
2. Not urgent & Important
3. Urgent & Not Important
4. Not Urgent & Not Important 

The focus of the matrix is to work as much as possible in 2. How to shift your focus from 1. to 2. 

### Gofer Delegation
"Go for this, go for that, do this, and tell me when it's done"

### Stewardship delegation
Focus more on results, might give tips a long the way but lets the person responsible for the task handle how to do it. Talks about the story of his son who is responsible for the garden, "You are your own boss".

## Public Victory
Habits 1-3 is about private victories while 4-7 focuses public victories.

### The Emotional Bank Account
A metaphor for relations and trust. You can deposit and you can withdraw emotionally to a person.

#### Ways to deposit

* Really trying to understand an individual, take interest in what they love.
* People are sensitive, the small things makes a difference between withdrawal and deposit.
* Keeping commitments/promises
* Claifying expectations
* Integrity
* Apologizing sincer when you make a withdrawal.

### P Problems are PC oppotunities
See every problem for another person as opportunities to build the relationship instead of something negative.

## Habit 4, Think Win/Win
Win/Win is when both parties thrive, it builds on the principle that there's enough out there for all parties to be satisfied. It's about coming up with solutions that earlier might not have existed, but together the two parties thrive. It's not compromising but rather coming up with the best possible solution together that both likes and feels good about. Win/Win is thinking long term!

### Character
Character is the foundation for win/win, and everything else builds on that foundation. Three parts Integrity, Maturity, Abundance mentality.

Maturity is the balance between courage and consideration, being able to listen and evaluate someones opinion and have that in consideration.
Abundance mentality, "There's is enough out there for everyone".

### Relationships
From the foundation of character, we build relationships. The emotional bank account.

## Habit 5, Seek First To Understand, Then To Be Understood
Habit 5 is about listening and trying to understand thoroughly with the person you're communicating with.

### Empathic listenin
There's a huge difference between listening to reply and listening to understand, make sure to focus on understanding rather than replying. 

### Diagnose before you prescribe
It might take a lot of time to really understand someone, you wouldn't want the doctor to make a prescription without really understanding your symptoms?

### Fourth stage empathic listening
Don't give a person your glasses when they come to you! They might have another problem than you, and giving them your glasses would make them see even less and probably would become frustrated on you.

* Try to understand
* Reflect on feelings, rephrase

When you finaly are sure you understand someone, then seek to be understood! Not the other way around.

## Habit 6, Synergize
Being greater than the sum of its parts.

Company mission statement with the help of all employees.

## Habit 7, Sharpen The Saw, Principles of Balanced Self-Renewal
Sharping your own saw, yourself!

P/PC yourself, physically (excersie, nutrition), Mental (Reading, planning, writing), Spiritual (Value Clarification & Commitment, Meditation) and Social/Emotional (Service, Empathy, Synergy)
